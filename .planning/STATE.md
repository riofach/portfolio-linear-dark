# Project State: Portfolio Linear Dark

**Current Phase:** 1 (Foundation & Navigation)
**Status:** Planning / Initialization
**Progress:** 0%

## Project Reference
**Core Value:** A polished, high-performance, and visually engaging online presence showcasing skills/projects with "linear-dark" aesthetic and subtle motion.
**Current Focus:** Setting up the Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 architecture and implementing the global navigation shell.

## Current Position
- **Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Navigation
- **Goal:** Initialize the project architecture and global navigation shell.
- **Plan:** [Pending `plan-phase`]

## Performance Metrics
- **Requirement Coverage:** 100% (19/19 mapped)
- **Architecture:** Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind v4, Motion v12
- **Design adherence:** Pending implementation

## Accumulated Context
- **Decision:** Using "Hybrid SPA" approach (Server Components for shell, Client Components for motion).
- **Decision:** Content separated into `data/*.ts` files for maintainability.
- **Decision:** Motion implementation deferred to Phase 3 to ensure solid layout structure first.

## Session Continuity
- **Last Action:** Created Roadmap and initial Project State.
- **Next Step:** Run `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to break down Foundation tasks.
