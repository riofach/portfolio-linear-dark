# Project State: Portfolio Linear Dark

**Current Phase:** 1 (Foundation & Navigation)
**Status:** Phase Complete (Pending Review)
**Progress:** 100% (Foundation & Navigation Complete)

## Project Reference
**Core Value:** A polished, high-performance, and visually engaging online presence showcasing skills/projects with "linear-dark" aesthetic and subtle motion.
**Current Focus:** Foundation and Navigation established. Ready for Content/Feature implementation.

## Current Position
- **Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Navigation
- **Goal:** Initialize the project architecture and global navigation shell.
- **Plan:** 01-01 (Completed), 01-02 (Completed)

## Performance Metrics
- **Requirement Coverage:** 100% (Phase 1)
- **Architecture:** Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind v4, Motion v12
- **Design adherence:** Navigation shell implemented with "Linear" aesthetic.

## Accumulated Context
- **Decision:** Using "Hybrid SPA" approach (Server Components for shell, Client Components for motion).
- **Decision:** Content separated into `data/*.ts` files for maintainability.
- **Decision:** Motion implementation deferred to Phase 3 (except Nav animations).
- **Decision:** Using Tailwind v4 CSS-first configuration.
- **Decision:** Navigation uses `IntersectionObserver` for efficient Scroll Spy.

## Session Continuity
- **Last Action:** Completed Navigation Shell (01-02).
- **Next Step:** Begin Phase 2 (Home Page Structure & Content).
