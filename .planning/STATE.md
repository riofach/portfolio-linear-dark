# Project State: Portfolio Linear Dark

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** A polished, high-performance, and visually engaging online presence showcasing skills/projects with "linear-dark" aesthetic and subtle motion.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Projects Archive Complete

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Projects Archive Page)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 05-02-PLAN.md

Progress: ██████████ 100%

## Accumulated Context

- **Constraint:** Use `src/components/layout/*` for Header/Footer (don't duplicate).
- **Constraint:** Remove filters from Projects Archive design.
- **Reference:** `_reference/projects.html` for layout/visuals.

## Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 05 | Used `/#section` for anchor links | Ensures navigation works from both home (scroll) and other pages (redirect). |
| 05 | Removed filters from Archive | Explicit design requirement for v1.1. |
| 05 | Visual-only "Load More" | Pagination out of scope for small project count. |

## Blockers/Concerns Carried Forward
None.
