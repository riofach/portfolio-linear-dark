# v1 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1 (Portfolio Linear Dark)
**Audited:** Fri Feb 06 2026
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

## Executive Summary

The v1 milestone is fully complete and compliant with all requirements. The project has successfully transitioned from a static HTML design to a high-performance, maintainable Next.js 16 SPA with a data-driven architecture. All 4 phases passed verification, including the critical gap closure for project data integration.

A minor UX improvement (adding "Experience" to the navigation menu) is identified as tech debt but is not a blocker for release.

## Integration & Flows

| **Navigation** | ⚠️ WARNING | `#experience` link missing from Header/MobileMenu (UX improvement). |
| **Styling** | ✅ VERIFIED | Global fonts and colors applied consistently. |
| **Motion** | ✅ VERIFIED | Transitions and micro-interactions work across all sections. |
| **Image Config** | ✅ VERIFIED | `next.config.ts` allows external project images (gap closed). |

## Tech Debt & Recommendations

2.  **Contact Form Backend:** Currently mocked with `setTimeout`; backend integration scheduled for v2.

## Conclusion

The milestone is verified and ready for completion. The project meets the definition of done.
