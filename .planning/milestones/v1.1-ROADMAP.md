## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Decision: **Single Page Architecture** (Rationale: Request to keep simplicity of the original design. Outcome: User navigates via scroll; no separate page loads.)
- Decision: **Separated Data Configs** (Rationale: To improve maintainability for Experience and Skills. Outcome: Content is edited in `data/*.ts` files, not deep in JSX.)
- Decision: **Future-Proof Projects** (Rationale: "Selected Work" needs to be dynamic later. Outcome: Projects data will use a structured array simulating an API response.)
- Decision: **Subtle Motion** (Rationale: User requested "professional" feel over "bold" effects. Outcome: Animations will focus on fade-ins, gentle slides, and micro-interactions.)
- Decision: **Hybrid SPA approach** (Rationale: Balance SEO and Motion. Outcome: Server Components for shell, Client for motion.)
- Decision: **Tailwind v4 CSS-first** (Rationale: Modern tooling. Outcome: Standardized styling with variables.)
- Decision: **CSS 3D Transforms** (Rationale: Performance. Outcome: Used for Hero grid instead of WebGL.)
- Decision: **Visual-only Contact Form** (Rationale: Scope management. Outcome: Deferred backend integration to later phase.)
- Decision: **Data-driven Skills Grid** (Rationale: Structure. Outcome: Organized skills by category.)
- Decision: **Native Scroll** (Rationale: Simplicity. Outcome: Removed Lenis for simplicity and robustness.)
- Decision: **Centralized Motion** (Rationale: Consistency. Outcome: Used `src/lib/motion.ts` for consistent physics.)
- Decision: **Metadata API** (Rationale: Modern Next.js. Outcome: Used Next.js 14+ Metadata API for SEO.)
- Decision: **MotionLink Pattern** (Rationale: UX. Outcome: Wrapped `next/link` with `motion.create()` for interactive cards.)
- Decision: **Used /#section for anchor links** (Rationale: Ensures navigation works from both home (scroll) and other pages (redirect).)
- Decision: **Removed filters from Archive** (Rationale: Explicit design requirement for v1.1.)
- Decision: **Visual-only "Load More"** (Rationale: Pagination out of scope for small project count.)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Implemented `/allprojects` archive page with responsive grid layout
- Upgraded navigation system for cross-page support
- Added consistent branding with `bg-grid-pattern` utility

**Issues Deferred:**
- Backend integration (Contact form email service)
- CMS integration (Sanity/Strapi)
- Internationalization (Bahasa Indonesia)
- SEO optimization (meta tags, OG images)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Minor: Nested `<main>` tags detected in `src/app/allprojects/page.tsx` (wrapped by layout's main). To be fixed in next cleanup.
